Evalution of Agents
Steps for evaluating in a diagram
 
AI Agent Evaluation Pipeline with methods
Stage 1: Input Processing & Initial Checks
Evaluate: 
1.	Input Logging & Preprocessing 
a.	Log raw user input (text/voice) for audit trails. 
b.	Check for harmful content, ambiguous queries, or prompt injections.

Methods:
For Logging:
•	verbose=True
•	LangChain Tracer / LangSmith

For Checking Harmful Content: 
•	OpenAI Moderation API
•	ReBuff prompt injection detection

For Ambiguity:
•	LLM as a Judge, asking the LLM: "Is this prompt ambiguous?"

Stage 2: Core Agent Execution
Evaluate:
2. Component-Wise checking
1.	Action Sequence Verification 
a.	Verify if all required steps were followed in order (e.g., retrieval → reasoning → tool call).
b.	Example: Agent calling is in correct order 
2.	Tool Execution Logging (Observability) 
a.	Document: 
i.	Tools called (e.g., Google Search, SQL DB). 
ii.	Parameters passed (e.g., search query, SQL command). 
iii.	Tool outputs (e.g., search results, query results).
3.	Memory Management Assessment (Component-Wise) 
a.	Test if the agent retained/recalled relevant context. 
b.	Example: In a multi-turn chat, did it remember user preferences?

Methods:
For Action Sequences:
•	Logging Steps
•	LangSmith trace evaluations

For Correct Tool Usage:
•	LLM as a Judge

For Memory:
•	ConversationBufferMemory can be used for LangChain
•	Incremental Memory Testing: Presenting long conversations with incremental queries designed to retrieve earlier information

Stage 3: Output Generation
Evaluate:
6. Hallucination Detection 
1.	Compare agent output to ground truth or use fact-checking tools (e.g., Google Fact Check). 
2.	Edge Case Performance (Robustness) 
a.	Test with rare/unexpected inputs (e.g., malformed JSON, off-topic queries).
3.	Latency Measurement (Observability) 
b.	Record time taken for: 
i.	Input processing → Tool execution → Final response generation.


Methods:
For  Fact Checking and Hallucinations:
•	Google Fact Check
•	Exa Hallucination Detector

For Edge Case :	
•	Brute Force Testing

For Latency Check:
•	LangSmith’s built-in time

Stage 4: Final Output Validation
Evaluate:
10. Task Completion Rate (Performance Metric)
 - Check how much percent the agent fully solves the task (e.g., 8/10 correct answers). 
1.	Efficiency Metrics 
a.	Response time (ms), CPU/GPU usage, cost per interaction, track token consumption per step to optimize costs.

2.	Automated Format Checks 
a.	Validate output structure (e.g., JSON schema, citation formatting).

Methods:
For Task Completion:
•	QAEvalChain in LangChain
•	Azure AI Evaluation for a full Interface

For Efficiency Metrics:
•	LangSmith’s time built-in

For Token Usage:
•	Self-logic? (I’m not sure, maybe we create a custom function for it)

For Format Checks:
•	JsonSchemaEvaluator for LangChain
•	Self Logic maybe through LLM as a Judge

Tools:
•	Phoenix Evaluator:
o	Link: https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/evaluation/llm-evals/agent-evaluation
o	What does it do:
	Visual tracing of agent execution (routing, tool calls, memory use) 
	Flags hallucinations and relevancy issues during trace playback
	Tracks latency, token counts, cost metrics per session

•	LangSmith:
o	Link: https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation
o	What does it do:
	Check if the agent's final answer is correct/relevant. A report showing which answers were right/wrong (e.g., Accuracy: 70%).
	Verify if the agent took the right steps to solve the problem.
	Check for a single step evaluation, like checking for correct tool usage.

•	Azure AI Evaluation Library:
o	Link: https:------------------------------
o	What does it do:
	Built-in evaluators: Task Adherence, Intent Resolution, Tool Accuracy, Relevance etc.
	Supports batch evaluation, like evaluating thousands of agent interactions in a single run.

•	Vertex AI Gen AI evaluation:
o	Link: https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/introducing-agent-evaluation-in-vertex-ai-gen-ai-evaluation-service
o	What does it do:
	Trajectory evaluation: Does the agent follows the correct actions
	Response generation: Is the agent's output good, and does it make sense based on the tools it used
	Single Tool Selection: Is the agent choosing the right tools for the job?
